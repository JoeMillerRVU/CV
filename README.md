## Vijay Kurian

I am a dynamic and ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer, keen to enter the world of tech in a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to product management and business strategy.

Throughout my experience at Makers Academy, I have understood the importance of best coding practices and this is my biggest priority in looking for my next role. I would love to work in a committed and supportive team, where these practices are adhered to.

In the past 9 years, I have worked at Heathorw Airport as part of the Security Training and Compliance team and while working there full time, I co-founded https://edge360.co.uk in 2015 and left Heathrow in 2017 to pursue it fully. Edge360 is a full service digital advertising and app development firm and in 2017 our turnover reached £3 million. I sold my share of the business in 2019 as I felt it was the right time to move on. I found myself intensly interested in the app development side of the business than business delivery/product management which was my remit. 

I have worked in large organisations and fast paced environment, with a large number of people on a daily basis, I value team work, honesty and integrity.
